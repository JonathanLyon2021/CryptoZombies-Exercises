# CryptoZombies-Exercises
Practicing Solidity on the CryptoZombies website. Building smart contracts & learning Solidity data types.

These are just basic exercises that are offered online on cryptozombies.io 
I am currently a student at kingsland university and I'm trying to further broaden my knowedge of Solidity 
and using cryptozombies was some advice that my JavaScript tutor mentioned to me at the time. 
Now I'm in Blockchain development and I can actually use this! Thank you for checking out my repo.

There are 6 different courses available in this website. I've completed 5 out of 6 courses so far. My goal is to complete all 6 courses.
